									<h4 style="text-align: center;">Go Vegetarian</h4>
									<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Benefits of Being Vegetarian:</h5>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">“Why should one be vegetarian? Because the God inside us wants it”, says&nbsp;Saint Dr. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan, the present Guru Ji of Dera Sacha Sauda.<br>
										One of the foremost principles of Dera Sacha Sauda stresses upon vegetarianism. Our religions have supported vegetarianism since ages. And now researches have also shown that human beings are vegetarian by nature. There are a number of evidences that reinforce people to be vegetarian; be it related to health, environment or ethics. The following sections share some of the facts beneficial for a healthy and happy living.</p>
									<div class="Htitle" style="text-align: justify;">
										<h2>Health:</h2>
									</div>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">Studies of human evolution have shown that our ancestors were vegetarian by nature. The structure of the human body is not suited for eating meat.&nbsp;
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #3c3c3c;">Dr. G. S. Huntingen of Columbia University, in an essay, pointed out that carnivores have shorter intestines. Their large intestine is characteristically very straight and smooth. In contrast, vegetarian animals have both a long small intestine and a long large intestine.</span> Because of the low fiber content and high protein density of meat, the intestines do not require a long time to absorb nutrients; thus, the intestines of carnivores are shorter in length than those of vegetarian animals.&nbsp;
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #3c3c3c;">Humans, like other naturally vegetarian animals, also have longer intestines. Together, our intestines are approximately twenty-eight feet (eight and a half meters) in length.</span>The small intestine is folded back on itself many times, and its walls are convoluted, not smooth. Because they are longer than those found in carnivores, the meat we eat stays in our intestines for a longer period of time. Consequently, the meat can putrefy and create toxins. These toxins have been implicated as a cause of colon cancer, and they also increase the burden on the liver, which has the function of getting rid of toxins. This can cause cirrhosis and even cancer of the liver.eat contains a lot of urokinase protein and urea, which add to the burden on the kidneys, and can destroy kidney function. There are fourteen grams of urokinase protein in every pound of steak. If living cells are put into liquid urokinase protein, their metabolic function will degenerate. Furthermore, meat lacks cellulose or fiber, and lack of fiber can easily create constipation. It is known that constipation can cause rectal cancer or piles.<br>
										The cholesterol and saturated fats in flesh also create cardiovascular disorders.<br>
										Cancer is the second leading cause of death. Experiments indicate that the burning and roasting of flesh creates a chemical element (Methylcholanthrene) which is a powerful carcinogen. Mice given this chemical develop cancers, such as bone tumors, cancer of the blood, cancer of the stomach, etc.<br>
										There is yet another concern. Antibiotics as well as other drugs including steroids and growth hormones are either added to animal feed or injected directly into the animals. It has been reported that people eating these animals will absorb these drugs into their bodies. There is a possibility that antibiotics in meat are diminishing the effectiveness of antibiotics for human use.<br>
										There are some people who consider the vegetarian diet not sufficiently nourishing.Renowned scientist working at scientific and industrial research council in national science institution, Bangalore, Dr. Keti has reached at the conclusion that vegetarian food is a complete food. A proper mix of vegetarian food items ,maintaining the nutrition at the time of cooking, eating boiled food, properly drying, sprouts and fermentation can increase the food quality. Milk and milk products have sufficient amount of protein, calcium and vitamins. The toned milk also contains 38 per cent of high protein. There is no nutritional element, which is present in meat and eggs and not available in milk. This is beneficial for the heart patients as well because it reduces the level of cholesterol in the blood; it is the antidote to several poisons.<br>
										The vegetarian food is rich in fiber whereas the non-vegetarian food is deficient in this element. These fibers are helpful in providing minerals and vitamins to the body. These avoid constipation and related diseases like piles, hernia, appendicitis, hepatitis, divertica, and varicose veins. These fibers are important because they protect us from stones and heart diseases by mutual action of cholesterol and bilirubin.<br>
										Many people have the idea that animal protein is ‘superior’ to plant protein because the former is considered a complete protein, and the latter is incomplete. The truth is that some plant proteins are complete, and that food combining can create complete proteins out of several incomplete protein foods.<br>
										It is often falsely believed that meat eaters are stronger than vegetarians, but an experiment conducted by
										<strong>Professor Irving Fisher</strong> of Yale University on 32 vegetarians and 15 meat-eaters showed that vegetarians had more endurance than meat eaters. He had people hold out their arms for as long as possible. The outcome from the test was very clear. Among the 15 meat-eaters, only two persons could hold out their arms for fifteen to thirty minutes; however, among the 32 vegetarians, 22 persons held out their arms for fifteen to thirty minutes, 15 persons for over thirty minutes, 9 persons for over one hour, 4 persons for over two hours, and one vegetarian held his arms out for over three hours.<br>
										Many long distance track athletes keep a vegetarian diet for the time preceding competitions.
										<strong>Dr. Barbara More</strong>, an expert in vegetarian therapy, completed a one hundred and ten mile race in twenty-seven hours and thirty minutes. A woman of fifty-six years of age, she broke all the records held by young men. “I want to be an example to show that people who take a whole vegetarian diet will enjoy a strong body, a clear mind, and a purified life.”<br>
										Does the vegetarian get enough protein in his diet?
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #3c3c3c;">The World Health Organization recommends that 4.5% of daily calories should be derived from protein. Wheat has 17% of it’s calories as protein, broccoli has 45% and rice has 8%. It is very easy to have a protein rich diet without eating meat. With the additional benefit of avoiding many diseases caused by high fat diets such as heart diseases and many cancers, vegetarianism is clearly the superior choice.</span>
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #3c3c3c;">The relationship between consumption of meat or other animal source foods containing high levels of saturated fats, and heart disease, breast cancer, colon cancer, strokes has been proven.</span>Other diseases which are often prevented and sometimes cured by a low fat vegetarian diet include: kidney stones, prostate cancer, diabetes, peptic ulcers, gallstones, irritable bowel syndrome, arthritis, gum disease, acne, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, hypoglycemia, constipation, diverticulosis, hypertension, osteoporosis, ovarian cancer, hemorrhoids, obesity, and asthma.</p>
									<div class="Htitle" style="text-align: justify;">
										<h2>The Environment:</h2>
									</div>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										<strong>Conservation of Fossil fuel:</strong> It takes 78 calories of fossil fuel to produce 1 calorie of beef protein; 35 calories for 1 calorie of pork; 22 calories for 1 of poultry; but just 1 calorie of fossil fuel for 1 calorie of soybeans. Eating plant foods instead of animal foods helps in conserving our non-renewable sources of energy.<br>
										<strong>Water Conservation:</strong>
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #3c3c3c;">It takes 3 to 15 times as much water to produce animal protein as it does for plant protein. As a vegetarian, one contributes to water conservation.</span></p>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										<strong>Efficient use of grains:</strong> It takes up to 16 pounds of soybeans and grains to produce 1 lb. of beef and 3 to 6 lbs. to produce 1 lb of turkey &amp; egg. Eating grain foods directly makes the food supply more efficient &amp; contributes to the environment.</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										<strong>Soil conservation:</strong> When grains &amp; legumes are used more efficiently, our precious topsoil is automatically made more efficient in its use. We use less agricultural resources to provide for the same number of people.<br>
										<strong>Saving our forests:</strong> Tropical forests and other tropic regions are destroyed daily, in part, to create more acreage to raise livestock. By not supporting the meat industry directly reduces the demand to pillage these irreplaceable treasures of nature. Since the forest land “filters” our air supply and contains botanical sources for new medicines, this destruction is irreversible.</p>
									<div class="Htitle" style="text-align: justify;">
										<h2>What religions say about it?</h2>
									</div>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">Indian religions avoid the eating of flesh. It is said that “People can’t get flesh without killing things. A person who hurts sentient beings will never be blessed by God. So, avoid taking flesh!” (
										<strong>Hindu Precept</strong>)<br>
										The holy scripture of
										<strong>Islam</strong>, the
										<strong>Koran</strong>, forbids the “eating of dead animals, blood and flesh.”<br>
										<strong>Jesus</strong> said, “People who have animals’ flesh become their own tombs. I tell you honestly, the man who kills will be killed. The man who kills living things and eats their meat is eating the meat of the dead men.”<br>
										Many great Greek philosophers such as
										<strong>Plato</strong>,
										<strong>Diogenes</strong>, and
										<strong>Socrates</strong> all advocated vegetarianism.<br>
										<strong>Holy Bible</strong> says “God said, I have provided all kinds of grain and all kinds of fruit for you to eat; but for the wild animals and for all the birds I have provided grass and leafy plants for food.” (
										<strong>Genesis 1:29</strong>) .<br>
										“You must not eat meat with blood in it, because the life is in the blood.” (
										<strong>Genesis 9:4</strong>) ”<br>
										God said, Who told you to kill the bullock and she goat to make an offering to me? Wash yourselves from this innocent blood, so I may hear your prayer; otherwise, I will turn my head away because your hands are full of blood. Repent yourselves so I may forgive you.”<br>
										<strong>St. Paul</strong>, one of Jesus’ disciples, said in his letter to the Romans, “It is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine.” (Romans 14:21)</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										<strong>Albert Einstein</strong>, the great scientist, also said, “I think the changes and purifying effects that a vegetarian diet has on a human being’s disposition are quite beneficial to mankind. Therefore, it is both auspicious and peaceful for people to choose vegetarianism.”</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										<strong>Gandhiji’s opinion:</strong></p>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">The religion does not allow us to eat eggs and meat, “looking at the climate of our nation we should stop the consumption of eggs, meat, and alcohol.”<br>
										<strong>A scientist’s opinion:&nbsp;</strong>
										<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Helvetica','sans-serif'; color: #3c3c3c;">The people who eat eggs appear to be very healthy in the beginning, and are very proud of them, their health is artificial and they have to lose their good health very soon. They contract different types of diseases and they have to consult doctors and ayurvedic practitioners in order to get back the lost health.</span>(Kalyan 9/73, page 964)</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										<strong>Manusmriti:</strong></p>
									<blockquote>
										<p style="line-height: 18pt; background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 10.2pt 0in; text-align: center;">

									<h5 style="text-align: justify;">Harmful effects of non vegetarian food to Human Health</h5>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some of the facts which shed some light on the harmful effects of being non vegetarian.<br>
										<strong>Non-vegetarian is not strength giving as is commonly portrayed:</strong><br>
										The bulls, horses, buffaloes, rhinos and elephants are vegetarian and very strong, but jackal, leopards and lions are not that strong in spite of eating meat. The lion is always afraid of attacking an elephant hence it attacks from the back. Dr. J.D.Krag, a strong supporter of vegetarian food says that he has found that several vegetarian&nbsp;people are more intelligent, physically strong and good sportsmen when compared to non-vegetarians.<br>
										<strong>Non-vegetarian is the cause for several diseases:</strong><br>
										According to the WHO report non-vegetarian food causes 159 different types of diseases. The most common diseases caused due to it are heart diseases, high blood pressure, kidney problem, gall bladder problems, wounds in arteries, eczema, paralysis, tuberculosis, constipation, pains, arthritis, hysteria etc. In comparison to this, the vegetarian food is totally harm less, beneficial and cures diseases.<br>
										<strong>Non-vegetarian food weakens the bones:</strong><br>
										American medical practitioner, Dr. A. Watchman and Dr. D.S.Bernstine have conducted a special study and declared their report. They said that non-vegetarian food weakens the bones gradually and they begin to deteriorate. The vegetarians have strong bones when compared to non-vegetarians. In the non-vegetarians high quantity of alkaline and salts are excreted through urine, which causes deficiency of these salts in the blood. The blood fulfills the deficiency from the bones. The imbalance reduces the resistance power in the human beings.<br>
										<strong>Wild nature/behavior due to consumption of non-vegetarian food:</strong><br>
										A famous scientist of Japan, Professor Venz has reached the conclusion on the basis of several experiments that non-vegetarian food plays a major role in raising the anger, anxiety, restlessness, hastiness, sexual desire and criminal mentality. Therefore it is true that minute substances of food make our mind and the mentality will be pious or passionate depending on the type of food we take.<br>
										<strong>Non-vegetarian food causes cancer and nervous diseases:</strong><br>
										According to Dr. Khar T Loder Braston, non-vegetarian food does not give strength and instead makes us weak. It produces nitrogen, which functions like poison for the nerves.<br>
										Dr. Arthur Underwood says that 85 per cent of the throat and intestine problems are due to non-vegetarian food. On the contrary , the vegetarian food contains substances which can prevent cancer.<br>
										The author of Diet and Food, Dr. Hugh, has differentiated between various strengthening and anxiety causing food products and said that vegetarian food is strengthening and non-vegetarian food causes anxiety.<br>
										<strong>Food Shortage for Millions due to consumption of non-vegetarian food:</strong><br>
										In the developed countries 6 tons of food is given to the cattle in order to produce one ton of meat. American scientist Borg Storm says that the amount of food given to the animals in order to obtain meat is sufficient to subside the hunger of world’s 50 per cent population. When 8 kg of vegetable protein is fed to the animals they produce one kg of meat protein. In the same way one non-vegetarian calorie can be obtained after burning 7 calories of vegetables. This is sheer wastage of proteins and calories.<br>
										Britain’s Bernard Vaidyaril says that it is beyond ethics to feed the animals with more than half the quantity of world’s food grain in order to obtain meat at a time when millions of people are starving. The same food could be given to them to satisfy their hunger. In order to obtain meat sufficient for the survival of ten people, the land that is used for this purpose if used for cultivating peas, barley, millets and other food grains can feed almost 100 people.<br>
										Avoiding the consumption of meat can reduce hunger: if the rich western countries stop eating non-vegetarian food then the food problem of the world can be overcome. On one hand the animals are given 40 crore tons of food every year, so that the rich people can eat the meat of these animals and on the other hand due to the deficiency of food grains around 50&nbsp;crore people from poor countries die due to starvation every year.<br>
										<strong>Eggs:</strong><br>
										Do you know that eggs have little amount of nutritional value? They are totally deficient in carbohydrates. The eggs are full of poisonous and harmful elements. Egg is the cause of several serious diseases; the high cholesterol content increases the risk of heart disease. The Hens eat sputum, phlegm, nose secretions, worms, germs and other such filthy things. The eggs are produced from these things.
										<strong>Do you think with all things Can egg increase the mental and intellectual quality of a person?</strong></p>
									<p>The above facts prove that Egg is very low in quality, filthy and the biggest enemy of. We can safely conclude that Eggs have lowest amount of nutritional content.</p>

									<p style="text-align: justify;">Eggs contain high amounts of cholesterol, which causes high blood pressure and kidney problems. Frying an egg increases its cholesterol level further. Heart specialist Dr. col. K.L.Chopda and Dr. K.K.Agarwal say that the yoke of egg contains 220 mg cholesterol, which is dangerous for the heart. Nobel prize winner Dr. Brown and Dr.Goldstin have proved that eggs contain high amount of cholesterol and hence increase the risk of heart attack.<br>
										<strong>DDT poison:</strong><br>
										30 per cent of the eggs contain DDT poison. This causes cancer, this was discovered by Lorida, America’s agricultural department.<br>
										<strong>Evidin:</strong><br>
										The egg white contains Evidin, which causes eczema and paralysis.<br>
										<strong>Acid:</strong><br>
										The eggs contain nitrogen and phosphoric acid, which produces acidic substances in the body, which makes the person diseased.<br>
										<strong>Infectious bacteria:</strong><br>
										The upper layer of the egg contains 15000 micro holes. The infectious bacteria entering the egg through these pores – salmonella, shigola and Staphylococci. These bacteria are responsible for disease of the intestines, due to which thousands of Indians die every year. Several thousands of people in England became the victims of a poisonous epidemic only because of salmonella bacteria.<br>
										<strong>Egg generates kapha:</strong><br>
										According to a German professor Egtur Burg, Egg is responsible for generating 51.83 per cent of phlegm, which imbalances the nutrition in the body and become the abode of disease.<br>
										<strong>Eggs are not easily digestible:</strong><br>
										Bile and pancreatic juices of egg are ineffective on egg white. Therefore 30 to 50 per cent of egg is excreted without being digested. This is the view of Professor Akoda of England.<br>
										<strong>Decay of food in the stomach:</strong><br>
										According to Dr. E.V. Mekkalam the eggs do not contain carbohydrates and the amount of calcium is also very low, hence it decays in the stomach.<br>
										<strong>Eggs contain very less amount of vitamins: </strong><br>
										Eggs contain very little quantity of iron, magnesium and vitamins. Especially vitamin B complex and vitamin C.<br>
										<strong>Egg causes diseases in any form:</strong><br>
										Professor of microbiology in the university college of medicine, Dr. V.Talwad says that egg causes different types of disease whether eaten raw or in any other form.<br>
										<strong>Hens have lots of diseases:</strong><br>
										The hens are carriers of bacteria and germs responsible for diseases like T.B and infect the persons eating it. (Dr. Robert Grass)<br>
										<strong>Hens are subjected to torture:</strong><br>
										The following methods of tortures are applied on hens in order to get more and faster production of eggs:<br>
										– The hens are given injections of special hormones for egg formulation.<br>
										– The male chickens are made to sit under the hot Sun and are not allowed to sleep to make them young quickly.<br>
										– More hens are fitted in to the farms, where they cannot flap their wings, they bite one another and get injured.<br>
										– The hens are forced to sit in the sheds through out the day.<br>
										– The wings and beaks are chopped off with the help of hot metallic instruments and machines. This hard truth was mentioned in the world-renowned book, height for a new America, written by John Robins.<br>
										– Is it not foolishness to eat eggs containing 13 per cent protein and sacrificing vegetable food items containing 22 to 43-pr cent protein?<br>
										– Is it not stupidity to eat eggs, which are responsible for generating serious diseases instead of nutritious and healthy vegetarian food.<br>
										– Is it good to eat eggs with 173 calories or vegetarian food containing 327 to 432 calories?<br>
										– Are we not encouraging violence and cruelty by eating the poor creatures that are subjected to different kinds of cruelty?</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">
										<strong>Inspirational factors for quitting eggs:</strong><br>
										Eating eggs and meat is against the Vedas:</p>
									<blockquote>
										<p>ya aamam maamsamadanti paurusheyam ca ye kavih<br>
											garbhaan khadanti keshavaastanito nashayaamasi
											<strong>– Atharva Veda 8.6.23</strong></p>
									</blockquote>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words “I destroy the people who eat meat and eggs.”</p>
