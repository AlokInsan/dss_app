							<p style="text-align: justify;">His Holiness Saint Dr. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan strongly opposes all intoxicants. He has been instrumental in campaigning extensively against drug addiction. Through the method of meditation, millions of people have been able to quit their deadly dependence on drugs. Guruji travels thousands of kilometers to act as a catalyst for transforming lives. Today, the number of people who have vowed never to partake intoxicants has exceeded 60 million and are growing. On one call by Guruji, people in thousands collectively pledge to get kick the drug habit. Public bonfires of intoxicants are made. People are whole heartedly supporting the renaissance for a clean, drug free society. And it is the result of his magical
								<strong>free meditation</strong> and inspiration that heaps of intoxicants like tobacco, hand-rolled Indian cigarette (also called bidis), cigarette, betel nuts etc. are burnt publicly in spiritual congregations when people throw them away instantaneously when inspired by Revered Guruji. Dera Sacha Sauda has come out to be known as a great drug rehab and reform centre. All the members of the organization are also working along with Guruji in the mission to save the society from drugs.</p>

								<h4>Quit Drug Abuse with meditation and selfless service:</h4>
								<p>“Drug abuse is a bad thing. Quit it. And those who want to give it up, come to the Ashram. Any kind of drug addiction you have, however dangerous, however old it may be, come and serve here in the ashram for 8 to 10 days and you will be able to give up your addiction without any discomfort. You will be provided residence and diet facilities free of cost. Medicines will also be provided free of cost if any need arises.”<br>
									<a>– An Appeal by His Highness Saint Dr. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan</a></p>

								<h4>Quitting drugs to save the Country</h4>
								<p>Drugs are an unholy weapon in the proxy war waged by terror outfits against the country. The youth are becoming physically unfit and unproductive because of drugs. When the children and youth are entrapped in intoxicants, the country will clearly spiral downwards. Also, it is well known that the trade in drugs is fuelling narco-terrorism. This is clearly a war that the whole world needs to win in order to defeat terrorism as well.<br>
